## Insomnia
By executing GET, POST, and DELETE requests, Insomnia has enabled us to demonstrate the application's functionality.

## Features
According to the current state of the application, the following features are available:
Markup : ```javascript
        ```
Markup : * The ability to return all the scholarships.
         * The ability to return specific scholarship via an ID number
         * The ability to filter via categories the scholarships:
             * ESOL
             * GENDER
             * ABORIGINAL/TORRES STRAIGHT
             * LOW INCOME
             * VISION IMPAIRED

         * The ability to return a particular favorite scholarship of a user using an ID number

         * The ability to return demographic information of users.                  


         * Implement appropriate authentication and authorization using Token Authentication.

         * The ability to return successful and unsuccessful status codes to the API, along with a way to handle failed requests gracefully (for example, a custom 404 page rather than the default error page)

## Future Implementation 

Markup : ```javascript
         ```    
        
Markup : * The hit counter for successful grants

         * Scholarship form for users to save scholarship information to duplicate for other scholarships

         * Users can delete their own profiles/deactivate their accounts

         * Display of scholarships applied for by users

         * Scholarships should be archived after they expire (not deleted)
